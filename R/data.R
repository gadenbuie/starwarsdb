#' Star Wars Data Schema
#'
#' Includes information about the schema of the tables that were sourced from
#' SWAPI, the _Star Wars API_. Not all properties returned from the API are
#' columns in the data in this package: some properties were refactored into
#' separate tables. For example, I combined the `starships/` and `vehicles/`
#' endpoint into a single table. Both API endpoints returned a "pilots"
#' property, which is described in the schema as an array of people who piloted
#' the vehicle. The information in this property has been extracted into a
#' separate table called `pilots` in the \pkg{starwarsdb} package.
